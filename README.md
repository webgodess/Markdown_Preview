# Markdown Editor and Previewer

This is a Markdown editor and previewer implemented using React. It allows users to input Markdown content in a textarea and see the parsed Markdown content in a preview section.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
1. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command `npm install` or `yarn install`.
1. Start the development server by running the command `npm start` or `yarn start`.
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port) to view the Markdown editor and previewer.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file responsible for rendering the React components and attaching them to the HTML file.
- **markdown.css**: The CSS file containing the styles for the Markdown editor and previewer.
- **README.md**: The readme file providing information about the project.

## Usage

The Markdown editor and previewer interface consists of a textarea where users can input their Markdown content and a preview section that displays the parsed Markdown in real-time.

### Markdown Syntax

The editor supports various Markdown syntax elements, including:

- Headings: Use `#` to create headings of different levels (`# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc.).
- Links: Enclose the link text in square brackets and provide the URL in parentheses (`[Link Text](https://example.com)`).
- Code Blocks: Use triple backticks to create code blocks (\`\`\`) and specify the language for syntax highlighting.
- Numbered Lists: Start each list item with a number followed by a period (`1. First item`, `2. Second item`, etc.).
- Block Quotes: Use the `>` symbol at the beginning of a line to create a block quote.
- Emphasis: Surround text with double asterisks (`**bold text**`) for bold emphasis.
- Images: Use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for alt text and parentheses for the image URL (`![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.png)`).

## Implementation Details

The Markdown editor and previewer are implemented as React components. The `Editor` component manages the state of the Markdown content and provides a textarea for user input. The `Parsed` component receives the Markdown content as a prop and renders it using the `ReactMarkdown` component, which parses and renders the Markdown as HTML.

The project utilizes the `ReactMarkdown` library for parsing and rendering Markdown content. Styling is applied using the `markdown.css` file.

## Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ReactDOM: A package that provides DOM-specific methods for React.
- ReactMarkdown: A library for parsing and rendering Markdown content.

These dependencies are managed using a package manager like npm or yarn.

Conclusion

The Markdown editor and previewer project provides a simple implementation of a Markdown editor using React. It can be used as a starting point for building more advanced Markdown editors or integrated into larger projects. Feel free to modify and expand upon the project to suit your specific needs.
